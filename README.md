# FindStudySpaces_App
Python webscraping script for Find Study Spaces App

The Find Study Spaces app can be found on my portfolio, and will hopefully be uploaded to the Apple App Store sometime in the future. The Find Study Spaces App allows users to find empty classrooms for a desired time period, and generate the weekly schedule of any classroom on campus. 

The webscraper utilizes BeautifulSoup to organize information into JSON files. All information is taken from the UIUC course explorer (https://courses.illinois.edu/). The JSON files are then transferred to the Xcode environment and the app is written using SwiftUI.
